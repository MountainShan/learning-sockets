# Since the client will send two messages, we need to `client.recv` calls here
# to read them -- on TCP, if the messages were sent fast enough, we would need
# only one call but won't be able to distinguish the messages since only one
# bytes object would be returned.

# WARNING: you should define a maximum message size for your application and
# use this value on `recv`; if not, you're going to read partial messages and
# won't know if they're partial or not. More about it on
# <http://stackoverflow.com/a/2862176/1299446>. You can also set the maximum
# socket buffers (send and receive) by using `.setsockopt` to the maximum
# message size you want (an exception will be raised if the application tries
# to send/receive more data than the maximum), but be aware of Linux doubling
# the max sizes: <http://stackoverflow.com/a/2031987/1299446>.
